# Artistic Style Transfer

The internal representations of Convolutional Neural Networks have demonstrated their ability to capture semantic visual information. 
It is possible to use that semantic space to transfer the style of a painting onto pictures or photographs.
Leon Gatys, Alexander Ecker and Matthias Betge, from the Centre for Integrative Neuroscience, have developed an Neural algorithm 
that is extracting semantic features of picture and artistic style, and recombining them to create a new picture.

The purpose of this project is to analyze the paper and implement and test the algorithm described.
We have chosen here the Keras frontend / TensorFlow backend. The code is developed in the Python environment.

The project was done as part of the CNAM RCP209 Machine Learning course.
